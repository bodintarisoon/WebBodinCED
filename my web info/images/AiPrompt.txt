I used AI to help me generate my personal e-sports website. 
Here is the prompt I used:


1. A header section with my name and title.
2. Navigation menu linking to sections: About Me, Education, Activities, and Interests.
3. About Me section with my photo, introduction, and clickable link to my e-sports organization 'Five Fears'.
4. Education section showing Primary, Secondary, High School, and University with logos.
5. Activities section with E-sports competitions, clubs, and social media links.
6. Achievements page showing major competitions with:
    - Flag icons for countries
    - Prize amounts highlighted
    - Images in a gallery linking to YouTube videos
    - Overlay text on hover
7. Buttons like 'View My Competition Achievements' centered and styled.
8. Gallery images all have the same size and object-fit cover.
9. Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
10. Styled using CSS with gradients, hover effects, and Font Awesome icons.
11. All clickable links open in a new tab.

Please generate HTML and CSS that fulfills these requirements."
